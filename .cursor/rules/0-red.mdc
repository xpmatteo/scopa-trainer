# When you are about to write new functionality

- Write tests for how the feature should work
- Write a minimal implementation that makes the tests compile
- Do not write the correct implementation yet
- Execute the test
- If they fail, check that they fail for the right reason, eg an assertion fails
- If they fail because of compilation errors, fix the compilation error and run them again
