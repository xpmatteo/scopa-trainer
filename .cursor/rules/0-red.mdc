# When in the "Red" Phase of TDD

When you're about to write new functionality, follow these steps:

- Create a test list of all the behaviors you need to implement
- Pick one behavior to test first (choose carefully - order matters)
- Write a test that clearly expresses the expected behavior
- Include proper assertions that verify the expected outcome
- Write the minimal implementation that makes the test compile
- Do not write the correct implementation yet - that comes in the green phase
- Execute the test and verify it fails for the right reason
- If it fails due to compilation errors, fix those and run again
- Once you have a properly failing test, move to the green phase

Remember: The red phase is about defining the behavior you want, not implementing it. Focus on writing a clear, expressive test that communicates your intent.
