# The "Red" Phase of TDD

The "Red" phase is the first step in the TDD cycle where you write a failing test.

## When writing a failing test:

- Focus on one specific behavior from your test list
- Write the test before implementing the functionality
- Make sure the test is readable and expresses intent clearly
- Include proper assertions that verify the expected behavior
- Ensure the test fails for the right reason (not due to syntax errors)
- Keep the test simple and focused on a single aspect of behavior
- Consider working backwards from the assertions
- Focus on the interface, not the implementation

## Common mistakes to avoid:

- Writing tests that don't actually assert anything
- Testing multiple behaviors in a single test
- Writing tests that are too complex or hard to understand
- Implementing functionality before writing the test
- Writing tests that pass immediately without failing first
- Focusing too much on implementation details rather than behavior
- Writing tests for code that already exists (unless adding test coverage)

## Remember:

A good failing test should clearly communicate:
- What functionality is being tested
- What inputs are being provided
- What output or behavior is expected
- Why the test is important

The test should fail because the functionality doesn't exist yet, not because the test itself is incorrect.
