When asked to create a new MDC rule:

- Always create the rule file in the `.cursor/rules` directory
- Save each rule as a separate file with the `.mdc` extension
- Use a descriptive filename that reflects the rule's purpose
- Include a clear title at the top of the file
- Provide detailed instructions in the body of the rule
- Format the rule using proper Markdown

Example structure:

# Rule Title
* Instruction point 1
* Instruction point 2
* Code examples if relevant
