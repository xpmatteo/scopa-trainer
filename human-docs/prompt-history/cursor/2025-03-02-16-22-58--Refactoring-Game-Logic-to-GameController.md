## Refactoring Game Logic to GameController

**User**:

move the logic in main.go to the GameController.  All the methods such as startNewGame should delegate to methods in GameController

**Cursor**:

I'll help you move the logic from main.go to the GameController. This will improve the separation of concerns in your code, making it more maintainable and testable.

Let me first examine the current GameController structure and then implement the necessary methods.

**Cursor**:



Now, let's look at the game package to understand the Deck implementation:

**Cursor**:



Now I'll update the GameController to include the methods that are currently in main.go:

**Cursor**:



Now, let's update the main.go file to use the GameController:

**Cursor**:



Now let's write a test for the GameController to ensure our implementation works correctly:

**Cursor**:



Now let's run the tests to make sure our implementation works correctly:

**Cursor**:



Great! All the tests are passing. Now let's also make sure the WASM code compiles correctly:

**Cursor**:





Perfect! The WASM code compiles successfully with our changes. Let's summarize what we've done:

## Summary of Changes

1. **Moved Game Logic to GameController**:
   - Implemented methods in the GameController that correspond to the functions in main.go
   - Added proper error handling and state management
   - Added a ToJSON method for serializing the game state

2. **Updated main.go**:
   - Changed the global variable from `deck` to `gameCtrl`
   - Modified all JavaScript-exposed functions to delegate to the GameController
   - Kept the UI rendering logic in the WASM code

3. **Added Comprehensive Tests**:
   - Created tests for all GameController methods
   - Verified edge cases like nil deck handling
   - Ensured proper state management

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Better Separation of Concerns**:
   - Game logic is now isolated in the GameController
   - WASM code only handles JavaScript integration and UI rendering

2. **Improved Testability**:
   - Game logic can be tested independently of the UI
   - Tests verify the behavior of each method

3. **Enhanced Maintainability**:
   - Changes to game logic can be made in one place
   - The code is more modular and easier to understand

4. **State Management**:
   - The GameController maintains the complete game state
   - This makes it easier to implement features like saving/loading games

The code now follows better software engineering practices with a clear separation between the game logic and the UI/integration layer. This will make it easier to add new features and maintain the codebase in the future.

**User**:

in this game a card can only be in one "place": in the player hand, in the AI hand, on the table, in the deck, in the player captures or in the ai captures.  There is no need to model all these places with slices; all we need is a map that defines for each card in which place it is.  Please add this map in the game package and update the logic accordingly

**Cursor**:

I'll implement a card location tracking system using a map in the game package. This is a good optimization that will simplify tracking cards and ensure each card can only be in one place at a time.

Let's start by creating a new file in the game package to define the card location types and map:

**Cursor**:



Now, let's write a test for our new CardLocationMap to ensure it works correctly:

**Cursor**:





Now, let's run the tests to make sure our implementation works correctly:

**Cursor**:





Great! All the tests are passing. Now, let's update the GameController to use our new CardLocationMap instead of multiple slices:

**Cursor**:





Now, let's update the controller tests to work with our new implementation:

**Cursor**:







Now, let's run the controller tests to make sure our changes work correctly:

**Cursor**:







Great! All the tests are passing. Now let's make sure the WASM code still compiles with our changes:

**Cursor**:







Perfect! The WASM code compiles successfully with our changes. Let's summarize what we've done:

## Summary of Changes

1. **Created a Card Location System**:
   - Added a `CardLocation` type to represent where a card is in the game
   - Implemented a `CardLocationMap` to track the location of each card
   - Added methods to move cards between locations and retrieve cards from specific locations

2. **Updated the GameController**:
   - Replaced multiple slices with a single `CardLocationMap`
   - Added getter methods to retrieve cards from specific locations
   - Updated the game logic to use the location map for tracking cards
   - Improved the JSON serialization to maintain the same structure

3. **Updated Tests**:
   - Modified existing tests to work with the new implementation
   - Added tests for the new card location functionality

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Improved Data Integrity**:
   - Each card can only be in one place at a time, enforced by the data structure
   - No risk of the same card appearing in multiple collections

2. **Simplified State Management**:
   - Single source of truth for card locations
   - Easier to track and update card movements

3. **More Efficient Operations**:
   - No need to search through multiple slices to find a card
   - Direct access to a card's location via its ID

4. **Better Encapsulation**:
   - Implementation details are hidden behind a clean API
   - Client code doesn't need to know how card locations are tracked

The code now follows a more efficient and robust design pattern for tracking card locations. This will make it easier to implement game rules and ensure that cards are always in a valid state.

**User**:

The old Deck struct should not be needed anymore -- please remove it

**Cursor**:

I'll remove the Deck struct since we're now using the CardLocationMap to track all cards. Let's make these changes:

**Cursor**:



First, let's update the controller to remove any references to the Deck struct:

**Cursor**:





Now, let's delete the deck.go and deck_test.go files since they're no longer needed:

**Cursor**:





**Cursor**:







Now, let's run the tests to make sure everything still works:

**Cursor**:







Great! All the tests are passing. Now let's make sure the WASM code still compiles:

**Cursor**:









Perfect! The WASM code compiles successfully. Let's summarize the changes we've made:

## Summary of Changes

1. **Removed the Deck Struct**:
   - Deleted `pkg/game/deck.go` and `pkg/game/deck_test.go`
   - Implemented card shuffling directly in the GameController

2. **Updated the GameController**:
   - Modified the `shuffleDeckCards` method to use the Fisher-Yates algorithm directly on the card locations
   - Implemented card swapping by temporarily moving cards to different locations

3. **Simplified the Codebase**:
   - Removed redundant code and dependencies
   - Consolidated all card tracking into the CardLocationMap

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Reduced Complexity**:
   - Single source of truth for card locations
   - No need to synchronize between multiple data structures

2. **Improved Maintainability**:
   - Fewer files and classes to maintain
   - More straightforward implementation

3. **Better Encapsulation**:
   - All card operations are now handled through the CardLocationMap
   - Implementation details are hidden behind a clean API

4. **More Efficient Operations**:
   - Direct manipulation of card locations
   - No need to copy cards between different collections

The code is now more streamlined and follows a cleaner design pattern. The CardLocationMap provides a single, consistent way to track and manipulate cards throughout the game, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

**User**:

move the shuffling logic to the card location map

**Cursor**:

I'll move the shuffling logic from the GameController to the CardLocationMap. This is a good refactoring as it keeps the card manipulation logic in the same place.

Let's update the CardLocationMap first to add the shuffling functionality:

**Cursor**:







Now, let's update the GameController to use the new shuffling method in the CardLocationMap:

**Cursor**:









Now, let's add a test for the new shuffling functionality in the CardLocationMap:

**Cursor**:









Now, let's run the tests to make sure everything works correctly:

**Cursor**:











Great! All the tests are passing. Let's also make sure the WASM code still compiles:

**Cursor**:











Perfect! The WASM code compiles successfully. Let's summarize the changes we've made:

## Summary of Changes

1. **Moved Shuffling Logic to CardLocationMap**:
   - Added a `ShuffleCardsInLocation` method to the CardLocationMap
   - Implemented the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm directly in the CardLocationMap
   - Used a temporary location to perform card swaps in the map

2. **Updated the GameController**:
   - Removed the `shuffleDeckCards` method
   - Updated the `StartNewGame` and `ShuffleDeck` methods to use the new `ShuffleCardsInLocation` method
   - Removed unnecessary imports (math/rand and time)

3. **Added Tests**:
   - Created a test for the new `ShuffleCardsInLocation` method
   - Verified that the shuffling works correctly and maintains all cards in the correct location

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Better Encapsulation**:
   - Card manipulation logic is now fully contained in the CardLocationMap
   - GameController only needs to know about high-level operations

2. **Improved Maintainability**:
   - Single responsibility principle: CardLocationMap is responsible for all card location operations
   - Easier to understand and maintain the code

3. **More Consistent API**:
   - All card operations are now handled through the CardLocationMap
   - Consistent approach to card manipulation

4. **Flexibility**:
   - The `ShuffleCardsInLocation` method can be used to shuffle cards in any location, not just the deck
   - This could be useful for future game features

The code is now more modular and follows better object-oriented design principles. The CardLocationMap is responsible for all card location operations, including shuffling, which makes the code more maintainable and easier to understand.
