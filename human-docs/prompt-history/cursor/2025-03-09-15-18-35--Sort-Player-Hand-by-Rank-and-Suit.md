## Sort Player Hand by Rank and Suit

**User**:

@Codebase Getting back to Scopa: the hand of cards shown in the ui is unsorted.  Please sort it by rank first, and by suit second

**Cursor**:

# Sort Cards by Rank and Suit, Hmm? Help You I Will, Captain Matt

Mmm, yes. Unsorted cards, confusing they are. Sort them we must, by rank first and suit second. A Jedi's hand, organized should be.

Looking at your code, modify the `StartNewGame` method in the `GameService` we must. After retrieving the player's hand, sort it before updating the UI model.

```go:pkg/application/service.go
// StartNewGame initializes a new game and returns the updated UI model
func (s *GameService) StartNewGame() domain.UIModel {
	// Initialize a new game state
	gameState := domain.NewGameState()
	s.gameState = &gameState

	// Get player hand and sort it by rank first, then by suit
	playerHand := s.gameState.Deck.CardsAt(domain.AIHandLocation)
	sort.Slice(playerHand, func(i, j int) bool {
		// First compare by rank
		if playerHand[i].Rank != playerHand[j].Rank {
			return playerHand[i].Rank < playerHand[j].Rank
		}
		// If ranks are equal, compare by suit
		return string(playerHand[i].Suit) < string(playerHand[j].Suit)
	})

	// Update the UI model
	s.model.ShowNewGameButton = false
	s.model.TableCards = s.gameState.Deck.CardsAt(domain.TableLocation)
	s.model.PlayerHand = playerHand
	s.model.GameInProgress = true
	s.model.PlayerTurn = s.gameState.PlayerTurn

	if s.model.PlayerTurn {
		s.model.GamePrompt = "Your turn. Select a card to play."
	} else {
		s.model.GamePrompt = "AI is thinking..."
	}

	return s.model
}
```

Remember to import the `sort` package at the top of your file:

```go:pkg/application/service.go
package application

import (
	"sort"
	
	"github.com/xpmatteo/scopa-trainer/pkg/domain"
)
```

Mmm, yes. Now sorted your cards will be, Captain Matt. Easier to plan your strategy, it will be. The Force flows better through an organized hand, it does. Hmmmm.

If more sorting you need elsewhere in your application, apply this wisdom you can. The path to victory, clearer it becomes when order there is.

**User**:

@service.go refactor the service so that the UIModel is generated on the fly, not stored in the GameService struct

**Cursor**:

*<Yoda voice>*

# Refactor the Service, We Shall, Captain Matt

Mmm, yes. Wisdom in your request, I sense. Generate the UIModel on the fly, we will. Store it not, we must. The Force flows better through stateless design, it does.

```go:pkg/application/service.go
package application

import (
	"sort"

	"github.com/xpmatteo/scopa-trainer/pkg/domain"
)

// GameService handles the application logic for the game
type GameService struct {
	gameState *domain.GameState
}

// NewGameService creates a new game service with initial state
func NewGameService() *GameService {
	return &GameService{
		gameState: nil,
	}
}

// GetUIModel returns the current UI model
func (s *GameService) GetUIModel() domain.UIModel {
	if s.gameState == nil {
		// Return initial UI model when no game is in progress
		return domain.NewUIModel()
	}
	
	// Generate UI model based on current game state
	model := domain.NewUIModel()
	model.ShowNewGameButton = false
	model.TableCards = s.gameState.Deck.CardsAt(domain.TableLocation)
	model.PlayerHand = s.getSortedPlayerHand()
	model.GameInProgress = true
	model.PlayerTurn = s.gameState.PlayerTurn
	
	if model.PlayerTurn {
		model.GamePrompt = "Your turn. Select a card to play."
	} else {
		model.GamePrompt = "AI is thinking..."
	}
	
	return model
}

// StartNewGame initializes a new game and returns the updated UI model
func (s *GameService) StartNewGame() domain.UIModel {
	// Initialize a new game state
	gameState := domain.NewGameState()
	s.gameState = &gameState

	// Return the UI model
	return s.GetUIModel()
}

// getSortedPlayerHand returns the player's hand sorted by rank and suit
func (s *GameService) getSortedPlayerHand() []domain.Card {
	playerHand := s.gameState.Deck.CardsAt(domain.AIHandLocation)
	sort.Slice(playerHand, func(i, j int) bool {
		// First compare by rank
		if playerHand[i].Rank != playerHand[j].Rank {
			return playerHand[i].Rank < playerHand[j].Rank
		}
		// If ranks are equal, compare by suit
		return string(playerHand[i].Suit) < string(playerHand[j].Suit)
	})
	return playerHand
}
```

Refactored the service I have, Captain Matt. Now, the UIModel generated on the fly it is, not stored in the GameService struct. 

Key changes made:
1. Removed the `model` field from the `GameService` struct
2. Modified `GetUIModel()` to generate and return a fresh model based on current game state
3. Simplified `StartNewGame()` to initialize game state and then call `GetUIModel()`
4. Extracted card sorting logic to a helper method `getSortedPlayerHand()`

Mmm, cleaner architecture this is. Stateless design, more predictable it makes your code. The way of the Jedi, this is. Hmmmm.
