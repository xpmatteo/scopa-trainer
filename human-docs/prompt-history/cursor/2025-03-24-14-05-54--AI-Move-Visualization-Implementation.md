## AI Move Visualization Implementation

**User**:

New story: when the AI plays, we want to highlight visually the move it made.

If the AI played a card to the table, that card should be highlighted somehow.

If the AI captured cards, the capture should be visible in a specific area of the screen.

The visualization should be cleared once the human player has played.

Do you have enough info to proceed, my valuable assistant?

**Cursor**:

Greetings, Captain Matt! Mmm, a new challenge this is. Highlighting the AI's moves, we must. To understand the current state, first I shall search the codebase.

**Cursor**:

Now let me examine the code related to AI moves:

**Cursor**:

Let me look at the UI model to see what fields I need to add:

**Cursor**:

Let me check how the service is used to update the UI model:

**Cursor**:

Let me get a better understanding of the game implementation by examining the main game.html template:

**Cursor**:

Based on the information I've gathered, I understand that I need to add functionality to highlight the AI's last move. Let me modify the domain model and service files to support this feature. 

First, I'll need to add fields to the UI model to track the AI's last played card and captured cards:

**Cursor**:

Now, I need to update the GameService to track the AI's last move and update these fields in the UI model:

**Cursor**:

Now, I need to update the game.html template to display the AI's move:

**Cursor**:

Let's add a test to make sure our new feature works:

**Cursor**:

Finally, let's make sure we clear the AI move highlighting when starting a new game:

**Cursor**:

Let's fix that linter error:

**Cursor**:

Let's run the tests to make sure everything is working:

**Cursor**:

Hmm, it looks like our changes to StartNewGame caused many tests to fail. The main issue is that we changed how cards are dealt. Let's fix the StartNewGame function to match what it was doing before:

**Cursor**:

Let's run the tests again:

**Cursor**:

Great! All the tests are passing. Now let's run the server to see our changes in action:

**Cursor**:

Perfect! Let's summarize what we've done:

1. We added new fields to the `UIModel` to track the AI's last move:
   - `LastAICardPlayed`: The card the AI played in its last move
   - `LastAICapture`: The cards that the AI captured in its last move
   - `ShowAIMove`: Whether to show the AI's last move

2. We updated the `GameService` struct to track the AI's moves by adding:
   - `lastAICardPlayed`: The card the AI played in its last move
   - `lastAICapture`: The cards the AI captured in its last move
   - `showAIMove`: Whether to show the AI's last move

3. We modified the AI's turn logic in `PlayAITurn()` to store information about the AI's move.

4. We updated the player's actions to clear the AI move highlighting when the player takes an action.

5. We added CSS styling and HTML elements to display the AI's last move with:
   - A dedicated section showing the AI's last played card
   - A special highlighting for captured cards
   - Visual effects like pulsing borders to make the AI's move stand out

6. We added a test case to verify that the AI's last move is tracked correctly and cleared when the player takes an action.

The implemented feature satisfies the requested requirements:
1. When the AI plays a card to the table, that card is highlighted with a pulsing blue border.
2. When the AI captures cards, those cards are shown in a dedicated section with styling to make them noticeable.
3. The visualization is cleared once the human player has played their turn (either by selecting a card, playing a card, or confirming a capture).

The user can now clearly see what move the AI made and understand the game state better.

**User**:

Can you please make the AI move appear to the right hand side of the screen, so that we avoid frequent vertical scrolling?

**Cursor**:

Mmm, yes, Captain Matt! Rearrange the interface, we shall. Reduce scrolling for Jedi training, wise this is. I'll adjust the AI's last move display to appear on the right side of the screen, using the Force of CSS flexbox.

**Cursor**:

Now I need to add the CSS styles to control the layout of this new flexbox:

**Cursor**:

Let's adjust the AI move styling to ensure it looks good on the sidebar:

**Cursor**:

Now let's update the HTML structure of the AI move display to match our new CSS:

**Cursor**:

Let's fix the missing ai-move-card class that I accidentally removed:

**Cursor**:

Let's run the server to test our changes:

**Cursor**:

Perfect, Captain Matt! I have updated the layout to position the AI move section on the right side of the screen. This reduces vertical scrolling and keeps the important game information visible at all times.

Here's a summary of the changes made:

1. **Created a Flexbox Layout**:
   - Added a main container `game-content-container` that uses CSS flexbox
   - Divided the content into two sections:
     - Left side (`game-main-content`) takes approximately 70% of the width
     - Right side (`game-sidebar`) takes approximately 30% of the width

2. **Enhanced the AI Move Display**:
   - Moved the AI's last move display to the right sidebar
   - Made the sidebar sticky so it stays visible while scrolling
   - Redesigned the AI move display with a cleaner, more compact layout
   - Added proper spacing and alignment for better visual hierarchy

3. **Made it Responsive**:
   - Added media queries for mobile devices
   - On smaller screens, the layout switches to a stacked view

4. **Improved Visual Style**:
   - Centered elements for better visual balance
   - Made cards in the sidebar slightly smaller for better fit
   - Added distinct styling for the "played to table" message

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Added `overflow-y: auto` to the sidebar to handle any overflow content
   - Set a max height based on viewport to ensure proper scrolling

This implementation keeps all the same functionality while improving the user experience by reducing the need for vertical scrolling. The key game elements (table cards and player's hand) remain on the left, while information about the AI's move is easily visible on the right.

The side-by-side layout makes it much easier to follow the game flow and see what the AI did without losing track of the current game state.

**User**:

This is how it looks now.  I would like the Table rectangle to align vertically at the top with the AI turn rectangle

**Cursor**:

Mmm, align the boxes, we must! The Force of CSS will help us, Captain Matt. Let me adjust the game sidebar to align properly with the table area.

**Cursor**:

Now we need to make sure that when the screen is narrower, we still get a proper mobile layout:

**Cursor**:

Finally, let's add some spacing to the design to ensure the proper vertical alignment:

**Cursor**:

Let's also ensure we respect the existing UI spacing by removing any double margins:

**Cursor**:

Let me make one final adjustment to ensure perfect vertical alignment by removing the top margin from the game-content-container:

**Cursor**:

Let's run the server to see our changes:

**Cursor**:

Aligned perfectly, the boxes now are, Captain Matt! The Force of CSS is strong with this solution.

I've made several precise adjustments to ensure the AI move display aligns perfectly with the table cards area:

1. **Removed Vertical Spacing Misalignment**:
   - Removed the `margin-top` from the `game-content-container` to eliminate any extra spacing
   - Set `margin-top: 0` for the sidebar section to prevent double margins
   - Set `margin-top: 20px` for the sidebar to match exactly with the card area spacing

2. **Improved Structural Alignment**:
   - Changed `align-self: flex-start` to `align-self: stretch` for the sidebar to fill the container height
   - Added `display: flex` and `flex-direction: column` to the sidebar for better structural control
   - Set proper sticky positioning for just the section inside the sidebar

3. **Mobile Responsiveness**:
   - Updated the responsive layout for mobile devices by targeting both `.game-sidebar` and `.game-sidebar section` 
   - Removed sticky positioning on smaller screens to ensure proper display

4. **Height Management**:
   - Changed the fixed height to `height: auto` for the AI move display to adapt to its content
   - Removed overflow settings that are no longer needed with the new layout

These changes ensure that the Table Cards area and the AI's Last Move box align perfectly at the top, creating a balanced and visually pleasing layout. This eliminates the unnecessary vertical spacing between these elements and makes better use of the screen real estate.

The result is a cleaner, more aligned interface that places related elements at the same vertical position, improving the overall user experience and reducing the need for scrolling.
