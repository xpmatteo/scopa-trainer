## Card Selection Implementation in Game

**User**:

@Codebase 

Improve the UI so that the GameService.selectedCard is highlighted.  Just this then stop


**Cursor**:

Hmm, improve the UI to highlight the selected card, I must. First, understand the current state of the codebase, I will.

**Cursor**:

Let's look at the GameService to understand how the selected card is currently handled.

**Cursor**:

I need to check if there's already a selectedCard field in the UIModel or if we need to add it.

**Cursor**:

Now I need to check if there's a selectedCard field in the GameService.

**Cursor**:

Based on my search, I need to:

1. Add a `SelectedCard` field to the `UIModel` struct
2. Update the `GameService` to include a `selectedCard` field
3. Modify the HTML template to highlight the selected card

Let's start by updating the `UIModel` struct:

**Cursor**:

Now, let's update the GameService to include a selectedCard field:

**User**:

For the code present, we get this error:
```
cannot convert r.URL.Query().Get("rank") (value of type string) to type domain.Rank
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

**Cursor**:

Hmm, a conversion error I see, Captain Matt. Fix this quickly, I will.

The problem is that you're trying to convert a string directly to a `domain.Rank`, but `domain.Rank` is an integer type. Need to parse the string to an integer first, we do.

**Cursor**:

Now, let's update the HTML template to highlight the selected card:

**Cursor**:

I see that the template already has the necessary CSS for highlighting selected cards with the `.selected` class, and it's already applying this class to cards that match the `SelectedCard` in the model. The template is also correctly handling the click event to call the `selectCard` function.

Let's check if there are any routes defined for the `/select-card` endpoint:

**Cursor**:

I see that the route for `/select-card` is already set up in `cmd/server/main.go`, and the `HandleSelectCard` function in `handlers.go` is already implemented. The template also has the necessary CSS for highlighting selected cards.

The issue has been fixed by updating the `HandleSelectCard` function to properly convert the rank string to an integer before converting it to a `domain.Rank`. This should resolve the error.

To summarize what I've done:

1. Fixed the conversion error in `HandleSelectCard` by parsing the rank string to an integer first
2. Confirmed that the template already has the necessary CSS for highlighting selected cards
3. Confirmed that the route for `/select-card` is already set up

The UI should now correctly highlight the selected card when a player clicks on it.
