## Reviewing HTML Template Tests

**User**:

Please take a look at the code base, especially @template.go @template_test.go and @game.html .  I implemented a new way of testing the html template, following advice in @TDD Html Templates .  I want to test the conditionals in the html template.

Please advise if there are other tests we should write

**Cursor**:

Hmm, a wise Jedi Master I am. Examine your template testing approach, I shall. Impressed with your visualization technique, I am. The Force is strong with your testing strategy, Captain Matt.

Looking at your code, see I do that you've implemented a clever way to test HTML templates using the visualization approach from Martin Fowler's article. Smart this is - converting complex HTML into a simplified text representation that's easier to assert against.

Additional tests you should write, hmm? Yes, yes. Missing some important scenarios, your tests are.

## Additional Tests You Should Write

1. **Test Card Selection State**:
   Test when a card is selected and how it affects the UI (showing capturable cards, enabling/disabling play area).

2. **Test Play Card Button States**:
   - When card is selected and can be played
   - When card is selected but cannot be played (disabled state)

3. **Test Game End Conditions**:
   - Game over screen
   - Score display

4. **Test Table-Driven Tests for Different Game States**:
   Use the table-driven approach from our Go testing rule for multiple game states.

Let me propose a test for the card selection state:

**Cursor**:

Now, let's create a table-driven test to cover multiple game states in a more concise way, following our Go testing best practices:

**Cursor**:

Let's also add a test for the POST-Redirect-GET pattern compliance, which is important according to your rules:

**Cursor**:

I see that you already have tests for the HTTP handlers that verify the POST-Redirect-GET pattern. Let's add a test for the template helper function to ensure it properly handles custom functions:

**Cursor**:

Let's run the tests to see if they pass:

**Cursor**:

We need to fix the failing tests. Let's update them:

**User**:

That's good, but I don't like though to have functions in my tests struct.  Couldn't we just have a UIModel and initialize it?

**Cursor**:

Ah, wise observation, Captain Matt. Functions in test structs, a Jedi prefers not. Simpler approach, we shall take. Hmm, yes.

Let me refactor the table-driven test to use direct UIModel initialization instead of functions. This will make the tests cleaner and more straightforward.

**Cursor**:

Now let's also add the missing tests for card selection and fix the template test:

**Cursor**:

Let's run the tests again to see if they pass now:

**Cursor**:

We need to fix the TestParseTemplates test. Let's update it:

**Cursor**:

Let's fix the import issue:

**Cursor**:

Let's run the tests again:

**Cursor**:

Excellent! All tests are now passing. Let's summarize what we've accomplished and suggest any additional tests that might be valuable:

**Cursor**:

Hmm, let me see the game.html template again to understand all the conditional logic we should test:

**Cursor**:

Excellent! Now I have a better understanding of all the conditional logic in the template. Let me summarize what we've accomplished and suggest additional tests.

## Summary of What We've Accomplished

1. **Implemented Visualization Testing**: We've successfully implemented a visualization approach for testing HTML templates, following Martin Fowler's article. This makes it much easier to test the template logic without dealing with the complexity of the HTML structure.

2. **Created Tests for Key Game States**:
   - Welcome screen
   - Game in progress with player turn
   - Card selection with capturable cards
   - Card selection with ability to play to table
   - Game over screen

3. **Added Table-Driven Tests**: We've created a table-driven test that covers multiple game states in a concise way, following Go testing best practices.

4. **Tested Template Helper Function**: We've verified that the template helper function works correctly with custom functions like `lower`.

## Additional Tests We Should Write

Based on the template logic, here are some additional tests we should consider:

**Cursor**:

Let's run the tests to see if our new tests pass:

**Cursor**:

Excellent! All tests are passing. Let me summarize what we've accomplished and provide some final thoughts.

## Summary of Our Template Testing Approach

Hmm, wise testing strategy you have implemented, Captain Matt. Impressed, Master Yoda is. Let me summarize our approach:

1. **Visualization Testing**: We've implemented a visualization approach that converts complex HTML into a simplified text representation, making it much easier to write assertions against the template output.

2. **Test Coverage**: We've created tests for all the key conditional logic in the template:
   - Welcome screen vs. game in progress
   - New game button visibility
   - Card selection and highlighting
   - Capturable cards highlighting
   - Play area enabled/disabled states
   - Empty hand/table states
   - Game statistics display

3. **Table-Driven Tests**: We've used table-driven tests for testing multiple game states in a concise way, following Go testing best practices.

4. **Direct Model Initialization**: We've used direct model initialization instead of functions in the test structs, making the tests cleaner and more straightforward.

5. **Template Helper Function**: We've verified that the template helper function works correctly with custom functions.

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Readability**: The tests are easy to read and understand, focusing on the business logic rather than HTML structure.

2. **Maintainability**: When the template changes, we only need to update the expected output strings, not complex HTML assertions.

3. **Completeness**: We're testing all the conditional logic in the template, ensuring that the UI behaves correctly in all states.

4. **Simplicity**: The visualization approach simplifies testing complex HTML structures.

## Possible Future Improvements

1. **Test for Accessibility**: Add tests to ensure that the template includes proper accessibility attributes.

2. **Test for Mobile Responsiveness**: Add tests to ensure that the template works well on mobile devices.

3. **Performance Testing**: Add benchmarks to measure template rendering performance.

4. **Integration Tests**: Add integration tests that combine the template with the HTTP handlers to test the full user experience.

Your approach to testing HTML templates is excellent and follows best practices. The visualization technique makes it much easier to test the template logic without getting bogged down in HTML details. This will make it easier to maintain and extend the template in the future.

**User**:

Now please write a new AI rule to explain this template testing approach 

**Cursor**:

I'll create a new AI rule to explain this template testing approach. This will be helpful for future template testing in your project.

**Cursor**:

Hmm, wise rule created I have, Captain Matt. The Force is strong with this template testing approach. Let me explain why this rule will be valuable for your future template testing:

## The Power of Template Visualization Testing

This rule captures the essence of your innovative approach to testing HTML templates. Instead of wrestling with complex HTML assertions that break easily when the markup changes, you've created a way to focus on what really matters - the template's behavior and logic.

### Key Benefits of This Approach:

1. **Focus on Logic, Not Markup**: By converting HTML to a simplified text representation, your tests focus on the template's behavior rather than its structure.

2. **Resilience to Design Changes**: When you update the HTML structure or CSS classes, your tests won't break as long as the functional behavior remains the same.

3. **Readable Test Assertions**: The expected output in your tests is human-readable text, making it much easier to understand what you're testing.

4. **Comprehensive Testing**: The approach encourages testing all conditional paths in your templates, ensuring complete coverage.

5. **Maintainable Tests**: When template behavior changes, updating the expected text output is much simpler than updating complex HTML assertions.

### The Visualization Technique:

The core of this approach is the `visualizeTemplate` function, which:
- Parses the HTML output
- Skips irrelevant elements like styles and scripts
- Converts interactive elements to a simplified representation (e.g., `[👆 Card-Name]`)
- Normalizes whitespace for consistent comparisons

This technique was inspired by Martin Fowler's article on TDD for HTML templates and enhanced with the clever use of data attributes for testing, a trick you learned from Esko Luontola.

With this rule in place, future developers on your project will understand how to properly test templates, ensuring your UI remains reliable and functional as it evolves.

May the Force be with your template testing, Captain Matt!

**User**:

In TestGameStates_TableDriven, we have the expected field formatted as a single line.  Please format it over multiple lines to make it easier to read, as in this example:

`
		Your turn. 
		Deck: 0 cards 
		Your Captures: 0 cards 
		AI Captures: 0 cards 
		Table Cards (1) [👆 Quattro-di-Coppe] 
		[👆 Click here to play the selected card to the table] 
		Your Hand (1) [👆 Tre-di-Denari]
	`

**Cursor**:

Hmm, easier to read, multi-line format would be, yes. Improve the table-driven tests, I shall.

**Cursor**:

Let's run the tests to make sure our changes didn't break anything:

**Cursor**:

Excellent! All tests are passing. Now let's also update our template testing rule to reflect this multi-line format in the examples:

**Cursor**:

Perfect! The changes have been applied successfully. Let me explain the benefits of this multi-line format:

## Benefits of Multi-line Expected Output Format

Hmm, much better this is, Captain Matt! The Force is stronger with multi-line formatting. Several advantages, this approach has:

1. **Improved Readability**: Each component of the expected output is now on its own line, making it much easier to read and understand what's being tested.

2. **Easier Maintenance**: When you need to modify the expected output, you can easily identify and change specific parts without affecting the entire string.

3. **Better Diff Visibility**: If a test fails, the diff will show exactly which line is different, making it much easier to identify the issue.

4. **Matches Visual Structure**: The multi-line format better represents the visual structure of the UI, with each line representing a logical section of the interface.

5. **Consistent with Visualization Approach**: This format aligns perfectly with the visualization testing approach, where we're focusing on the logical structure rather than the HTML details.

The template testing rule has also been updated to include this best practice, ensuring that future tests will follow the same pattern.

All tests are passing, and the code is now more maintainable and easier to read. The template visualization testing approach you've implemented is a powerful way to test HTML templates, and the multi-line format makes it even more effective.

May the Force be with your template testing, Captain Matt!

**User**:

I see we have a separate test for the card having the "selected" class.  I would like to move it to the tableDriven test.  Let's change the visualizeNode function so that it visualizes the presence of the selected class in some way that we can then assert against in the expected output

**Cursor**:

Hmm, wise suggestion, Captain Matt. Consolidate tests, we should. Modify the visualizeNode function to show selected cards differently, I will.

**Cursor**:

Now let's update the table-driven tests to include a test case for selected cards and update the existing tests to account for the new visualization format:

**Cursor**:

Now that we've updated the visualizeNode function and the table-driven tests, let's run the tests to see if they pass:

**Cursor**:

We need to update the individual test cases to match the new visualization format with the ✓ and ⭐ symbols. Let's fix those tests:

**Cursor**:

Let's run the tests again to see if they pass now:

**Cursor**:

Great! All tests are now passing. Let's update our template testing rule to include this new approach of visualizing card states:

**Cursor**:

Now that we've successfully updated our template testing approach to include visual indicators for card states, let's see if we can remove the standalone tests for card highlighting since they're now covered by the table-driven tests:

**Cursor**:

Let's run the tests again to make sure everything still passes:

**Cursor**:

Perfect! All tests are still passing. Let me summarize the improvements we've made to the template testing approach:

## Summary of Improvements to Template Testing

Hmm, much improved our template testing is, Captain Matt! The Force is strong with these changes:

1. **Enhanced Visualization with State Indicators**:
   - Added ✓ symbol to indicate selected cards
   - Added ⭐ symbol to indicate capturable cards
   - This makes it easier to visually identify card states in the test output

2. **Consolidated Tests in Table-Driven Format**:
   - Moved individual card highlighting tests into the table-driven tests
   - This reduces duplication and makes the tests more maintainable
   - Each test case now clearly shows the expected output with state indicators

3. **Multi-line Expected Output**:
   - Formatted expected output over multiple lines for better readability
   - Each line represents a logical section of the UI
   - Makes it easier to identify issues when tests fail

4. **Updated Template Testing Rule**:
   - Added requirement to visualize element states with symbols
   - Updated examples to show how to implement state indicators
   - This ensures future template tests will follow the same pattern

These improvements make your template tests:
- More readable
- More maintainable
- More comprehensive
- More focused on the template logic rather than HTML structure

The visualization approach with state indicators is particularly powerful because it allows you to test multiple aspects of the template in a single test case, including:
- Content rendering
- Conditional logic
- Element states (selected, capturable, etc.)
- UI structure

This approach aligns perfectly with the principles of visualization testing for HTML templates, focusing on what the template does rather than how it's structured.

May the Force be with your template testing, Captain Matt!

**User**:

my only concern now is that while our expected text is nicely formatted with newlines, the output of normalize whitespace is not!  I have an idea:
- modify the normalizeWhitespace to leave newlines alone
- modify the game template to use <section> elements to mark the major UI areas such as the player hand or the table.  
- modify visualizeTemplate to render <section> with newlines

**Cursor**:

Hmm, wise idea you have, Captain Matt! Preserve the newlines in our test output, we should. Make the tests more readable and maintainable, this will.

Let's implement your suggestions one by one:

1. First, let's modify the `normalizeWhitespace` function to preserve newlines:

**Cursor**:

2. Now, let's modify the `visualizeTemplate` function to add newlines for major UI sections:

**Cursor**:

3. Now, let's modify the game template to use `<section>` elements for major UI areas:

**Cursor**:

4. Now, let's update our test expectations to match the new format with sections:

**Cursor**:

5. Finally, let's update the table-driven tests to match the new format:

**Cursor**:

Let's run the tests to see if our changes work:

**Cursor**:

We need to fix a few issues with the visualization. Let's update the `visualizeNode` function to handle the play area and other elements better:

**Cursor**:

Let's run the tests again to see if our changes fixed the issues:

**Cursor**:

We need to update our test expectations to match the actual output format. Let's update all the test expectations:

**Cursor**:

Let's run the tests again to see if our changes fixed the issues:

**Cursor**:

Great! All tests are now passing. Let's update our template testing rule to include this new approach with sections and newlines:

**Cursor**:

Perfect! Now we have a comprehensive template testing approach that:

1. Uses sections with data-section attributes to organize the UI
2. Preserves newlines in the output for better readability
3. Visualizes element states with symbols (✓, ⭐, etc.)
4. Makes it easy to test conditional logic in templates

Let me summarize what we've accomplished:

## Summary of Improvements

Hmm, much improved our template testing is, Captain Matt! The Force is strong with these changes:

1. **Structured Visualization with Sections**:
   - Added `<section>` elements with `data-section` attributes to organize the UI
   - Rendered sections with clear visual separation and headers
   - This makes the test output much more readable and organized

2. **Preserved Newlines in Output**:
   - Modified `normalizeWhitespace` to preserve newlines while still normalizing other whitespace
   - This makes the test output match the logical structure of the UI
   - Makes it easier to read and understand the test expectations

3. **Enhanced State Visualization**:
   - Added visual indicators for element states (✓ for selected, ⭐ for capturable)
   - This makes it easy to see which elements have special states
   - Makes the tests more comprehensive and focused on behavior

4. **Updated Template Testing Rule**:
   - Added requirements for sections and newline preservation
   - Updated examples to show the new approach
   - This ensures future template tests will follow the same pattern

These improvements make your template tests:
- More readable
- More maintainable
- More comprehensive
- More focused on the template logic rather than HTML structure

The visualization approach with sections and newlines is particularly powerful because it allows you to test multiple aspects of the template in a single test case, with a clear visual representation of the UI structure.

May the Force be with your template testing, Captain Matt!
